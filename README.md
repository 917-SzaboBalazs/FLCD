# FLCD

## Description
FLCD (Formal Languages and Compiler Design) is a repository containing Python code for implementing a scanner and parser for a formal language.

## Folder Structure
The repository contains the following folders:

1. **Scanner**: This folder contains the Python code for implementing a scanner, which is responsible for tokenizing input strings according to the rules of the formal language.

2. **Parser**: This folder contains the Python code for implementing a parser, which is responsible for parsing tokenized input strings. It also contains an LL1 parsing algorithm.

## Getting Started
To get started with FLCD, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/917-SzaboBalazs/FLCD.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd FLCD
   ```

3. Explore the contents of the `Scanner` and `Parser` folders to understand the implementation details.

4. Run the Python scripts to test the scanner and parser functionality.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## Usage
- **Scanner**: Execute the scanner script to tokenize input strings.
  ```
  cd Scanner
  python main.py
  ```
- **Parser**: Execute the parser script to parse tokenized input strings.
  ```
  cd Parser
  python main.py
  ```
